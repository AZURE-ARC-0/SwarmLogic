# SwarmLogic: Your Fluid AI-Powered Backend 

SwarmLogic is an innovative backend solution leveraging swarm intelligence and powered by advanced AI models. It evolves based on API calls, automatically inferring business logic and managing data persistence, saving you from the complexities of traditional backend development.

## Objective

SwarmLogic aims to revolutionize backend development by reducing complexity, saving time, and increasing efficiency. We aim to create a system where backends can evolve based on API calls, automatically inferring business logic, and managing data persistence.

## Architecture

SwarmLogic follows a unique architecture inspired by swarm intelligence. At its core, SwarmLogic utilizes an array of AI agents, each capable of learning and adapting from every API call.

* API Calls: The starting point of our architecture. Any API call triggers our AI swarm.
* AI Swarm: A group of AI agents that interpret the API calls, infer the business logic, and handle the data state.
* Business Logic Inference: Our AI agents use natural language understanding and processing capabilities to understand the purpose of the API call and derive the business logic.
* Data State Management: SwarmLogic automatically manages the data state based on the inferred business logic. It can handle data persistence for different schemas and data sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- FastAPI
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/SwarmLogic.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the `SwarmLogic` directory:

```bash
cd SwarmLogic
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The FastAPI server will start and you can interact with the backend via `http://localhost:8000`.

For API calls, make a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/{app_name}/{api_call}` with a JSON body.

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/todo_list/create_todo" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"app_name\":\"todo_list\",\"api_call\":\"create_todo\"}"
```

In case of an error or exception, check the `app.log` file in the root directory for detailed information.

## Overview

SwarmLogic brings the power of swarms to backend development. Our innovative AI-powered backend utilizes swarm intelligence to handle and evolve your business logic and data state. You don't need to write extensive backend code or manage data persistency anymore. SwarmLogic does it for you.


# SwarmLogic: Swarms is All You Need for a Backend

## 1. The Present State

In the current tech landscape, developing software, particularly web applications, involves a time-consuming and complex process of building and maintaining a robust backend. Backend engineers spend countless hours writing, reviewing, and debugging code to meet business logic requirements and ensure efficient data persistence. These challenges are multiplied when we scale and involve numerous API calls, different levels of abstraction, complex schemas, and disparate data sources. This state of affairs, although functional, leaves a lot of room for optimization, efficiency, and innovation.

## 2. Envisioning the Future 

Ideally, we envision a world where the process of creating and maintaining backends is streamlined, efficient, and adaptable. We foresee an environment where backend infrastructure is self-evolving, where business logic is inferred and handled on the fly, and where data persistence is no longer a hurdle. This evolution eliminates the need for traditional code review processes and the limitations of explicit programming, freeing up resources and time to focus on developing innovative applications and services.

## 3. The Challenges and Opportunities

The challenge here is creating a self-sustaining backend infrastructure that is flexible, intuitive, and intelligent enough to handle varying business logics and data states. Previous attempts have been hindered by the lack of effective natural language understanding and processing capabilities, the inability to infer from context, and the constraints of current backend architectures. However, the development of sophisticated AI models has created a massive opportunity. By harnessing the power of these models to interpret API calls, infer business logic, and manage data state, we could revolutionize the backend development process. Whoever manages to create a scalable and effective solution that leverages AI in this way stands to reshape the future of web application development.

## 4. Our Unique Solution

The secret to our solution lies in the power of swarm intelligence. Inspired by the natural phenomena where a group of agents operates intelligently as a whole without a central authority, SwarmLogic uses an ensemble of AI agents to create a self-evolving backend. Our model learns from every API call, intelligently infers the business logic, adapts to changing requirements, and manages data state without the need for explicit programming. It transforms the way backends are developed and maintained, bringing us closer to our envisioned future.

## 5. Why SwarmLogic?

SwarmLogic is not just another tech project; it is the culmination of extensive research and expertise in AI and software development. We are backed by a team of 1,500+ AI researchers, software engineers, and technology enthusiasts committed to innovating and revolutionizing how backends are built. We have dedicated ourselves to solving this challenge, and our deep knowledge of AI models, programming languages, and backend architectures makes us uniquely positioned to achieve this. Join us as we create the future of backend development with SwarmLogic.

# SwarmLogic: Your AI-Driven Backend

## Roadmap

In our quest to revolutionize backend development, we're setting out on a roadmap that charts not only our plan but our ambition. Each step on this path is a calculated, purposeful move towards making our vision a reality.


#### Phase1 Core Development & Learning

Our initial focus will be on developing and refining SwarmLogic's basic architecture and features. This includes setting up our AI swarm's ability to learn from every API call, infer business logic, and handle data state. During this phase, we also aim to integrate a mechanism for constant learning, enabling SwarmLogic to evolve continuously with every API call.
 

#### Phase 2: Advanced Data Persistence & Intelligent Error Handling

The next phase will see the introduction of more sophisticated data persistence features. Our goal is to allow SwarmLogic to handle an increasingly diverse array of schemas and data sources efficiently. In addition, we will focus on developing SwarmLogic's ability to intelligently handle errors, a feature that will allow it to learn from its mistakes and ensure better performance over time.

#### Phase 3 Enhanced Business Logic Inference & AI Swarm Refinement

We aim to enhance SwarmLogic's business logic inference abilities during this period, making it capable of understanding increasingly complex API calls and inferring more nuanced business logic. We will also refine the AI swarm's algorithms and mechanisms to improve its learning efficiency and accuracy.

### Performance & Integration

#### Optimization & Performance Enhancement

Our focus for the first half of the year will be on optimization and performance enhancement. We aim to make SwarmLogic more efficient in terms of resource usage and more robust in handling high-volume, complex API calls.

During this phase, we plan to develop integrations with major development platforms to allow easy adoption of SwarmLogic. We will also expand the range of programming languages that SwarmLogic can interact with, increasing its versatility and usability.

### Phase 4

#### Industry Mastery & New Horizons

As we continue to refine and enhance SwarmLogic, we aspire to become the de facto solution for backend development. Our goal is to expand SwarmLogic's capabilities to handle even more complex and niche requirements. We are committed to keeping up with emerging technologies, trends, and user needs to ensure SwarmLogic stays at the forefront of backend development solutions.

This roadmap embodies our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in backend development. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey with SwarmLogic, where swarms become the backbone of your backend!
