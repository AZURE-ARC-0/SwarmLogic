# SwarmLogic: Your Futuristic, AI-Powered Backend 

## Overview

SwarmLogic brings the power of swarms to backend development. Our innovative AI-powered backend utilizes swarm intelligence to handle and evolve your business logic and data state. You don't need to write extensive backend code or manage data persistency anymore. SwarmLogic does it for you.

## Objective

SwarmLogic aims to revolutionize backend development by reducing complexity, saving time, and increasing efficiency. We aim to create a system where backends can evolve based on API calls, automatically inferring business logic, and managing data persistence.

## Architecture

SwarmLogic follows a unique architecture inspired by swarm intelligence. At its core, SwarmLogic utilizes an array of AI agents, each capable of learning and adapting from every API call.

* API Calls: The starting point of our architecture. Any API call triggers our AI swarm.
* AI Swarm: A group of AI agents that interpret the API calls, infer the business logic, and handle the data state.
* Business Logic Inference: Our AI agents use natural language understanding and processing capabilities to understand the purpose of the API call and derive the business logic.
* Data State Management: SwarmLogic automatically manages the data state based on the inferred business logic. It can handle data persistence for different schemas and data sources.
